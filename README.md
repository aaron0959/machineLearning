# machineLearning
This project is designed to take an image as an input and detect any anomalied to determine if the image is of a broken bone or not
Used the stanford MURA dataset for this -- will need it on own machine to link and train
This model trains using a variety of xrays and then will take an image of an xray to determine the anomalies.
All imports are at the beginnign of the code -- will need to install the libraries on own machine if not already on there
